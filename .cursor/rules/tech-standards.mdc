# Technology Standards Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the technology standards adopted by the project. It covers coding style, architectural best practices, and quality assurance measures that ensure long-term maintainability and scalability.

## Coding Standards
- Adhere to language-specific style guides.
- Enforce code formatting using linters and auto-format tools.
- Write clear and self-documenting code with inline comments where necessary.

## Architectural Guidelines
- Use modular design and separation of concerns.
- Prefer dependency injection and configuration-based setups.
- Ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability of the architecture.

## Tooling and Automation
- Integrate continuous integration pipelines and automated testing.
- Maintain consistent configuration across development, testing, and production environments.
- Use version control with meaningful commit messages following the "[Cursor]" convention.

## Additional Considerations
- Stay updated with industry best practices.
- Periodically review and update the standards based on feedback and technological advances.
