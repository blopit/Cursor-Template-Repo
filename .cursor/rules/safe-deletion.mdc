# Safe Deletion Guidelines

## Critical Resources Protection

### Protected Resources
- Databases and tables
- Production data
- User data
- Configuration files
- Virtual environments
- Credentials and secrets
- Deployment artifacts
- Backup files

### Pre-deletion Checklist
1. Verify current environment (dev/staging/prod)
2. Check for dependent systems
3. Create backup if applicable
4. Document the deletion
5. Get required approvals
6. Use safe deletion methods
7. Verify backup integrity

## Database Operations

### Database Safety
- NEVER use `DROP DATABASE` without backup
- NEVER use `DROP TABLE` without backup
- Always use transactions for destructive operations
- Keep deletion scripts in version control
- Test deletions in development first

### Safe Database Changes
```sql
-- Example of safe table modification
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  -- Create backup
  CREATE TABLE table_name_backup AS SELECT * FROM table_name;
  
  -- Verify backup
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name_backup;
  
  -- Perform operation
  -- ALTER TABLE / DELETE / etc.
  
  -- Verify results
  -- If success: COMMIT
  -- If failure: ROLLBACK
COMMIT;
```

## File System Operations

### Virtual Environments
- Backup pip requirements before deletion
- Check for custom configurations
- Verify no active processes using the environment
- Use safe deletion commands with confirmation

### Safe Environment Recreation
```bash
# Backup requirements
pip freeze > requirements.backup.txt

# Compare with existing requirements
diff requirements.txt requirements.backup.txt

# Create new environment only after verification
python -m venv new_env_name

# Test new environment before removing old
```

## Code and Configuration

### Source Code
- Never use `git clean -fdx` without review
- Always check git status before destructive operations
- Commit or stash changes before major operations
- Use `git clean -n` to preview deletions

### Configuration Files
- Always backup configs before deletion
- Keep template versions in version control
- Document configuration changes
- Verify replacement configs exist

## Safe Deletion Commands

### File Operations
```bash
# Instead of rm -rf, use:
rm -i  # Interactive deletion
rm -I  # Prompt once for 3+ files

# For directories:
mv directory directory_old  # Rename first
ls -la directory_old       # Verify contents
rm -r directory_old       # Remove after verification
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Export before dropping
pg_dump dbname > backup.sql

# Rename instead of drop
ALTER DATABASE name RENAME TO name_deprecated;

# Archive tables instead of dropping
ALTER TABLE name RENAME TO name_archived_YYYYMMDD;
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Backup Verification
- Test backups regularly
- Keep multiple backup generations
- Document restoration procedures
- Practice recovery scenarios

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# Database restore
psql dbname < backup.sql

# File recovery
cp -a backup_dir/* original_dir/

# Environment recreation
pip install -r requirements.backup.txt
```

## Best Practices

### General Guidelines
- Use soft deletes where possible
- Implement deletion grace periods
- Keep audit logs of deletions
- Use role-based access control
- Implement deletion confirmations

### Documentation Requirements
- Document what is being deleted
- Record why deletion is necessary
- Note any dependencies affected
- Include rollback procedures
- List verification steps taken

## Automation Safety

### Scripts and Tools
- Include dry-run options
- Implement confirmation prompts
- Log all operations
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide rollback capabilities

### Example Script Structure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Confirmation function
confirm() {
    read -r -p "${1:-Are you sure? [y/N]} " response
    case "$response" in
        [yY][eE][sS]|[yY]) 
            true
            ;;
        *)
            false
            ;;
    esac
}

# Backup function
backup() {
    timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
    cp -a "$1" "${1}_backup_${timestamp}"
}

# Main operation
if confirm "This will delete X. Are you sure? [y/N]"; then
    backup "resource_to_delete"
    # Perform deletion
    echo "Operation completed"
else
    echo "Operation cancelled"
    exit 1
fi
```
