# Error Patterns Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides guidance on identifying, analyzing, and resolving common error patterns encountered during development. It aims to improve debugging efficiency and ensure consistent error handling practices across the project.

## Common Error Patterns
- **Syntax and Runtime Errors:** Issues related to language syntax or unexpected runtime behavior.
- **Logic Errors:** Flaws in the algorithm or code logic causing incorrect outcomes.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Inefficient code that degrades performance.
- **Dependency Issues:** Failures due to missing or incompatible libraries.

## Debugging Guidelines
- Use descriptive logging to capture error details.
- Reproduce errors reliably in isolated environments.
- Leverage automated tests to detect regressions.
- Document resolution steps and share learnings with the team.

## Best Practices
- Prioritize fixing errors based on impact and frequency.
- Regularly review error logs to identify recurring issues.
- Continuously refine error handling strategies.
