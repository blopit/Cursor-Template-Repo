# Hook Installation Script Documentation

## Purpose
The hook installation script simplifies the process of installing Git hooks by copying them from the tools/hooks directory to the .git/hooks directory and making them executable.

## Usage
To install all Git hooks:

```bash
# Run the installation script
./tools/install_hooks.sh
```

This will install:
- The pre-commit hook that enforces MDC documentation requirements

## Dependencies
List of dependencies and relationships with other files/components:

- `tools/hooks/pre-commit`: The pre-commit hook that enforces MDC documentation
- `.cursor/rules/file-creation-standards.mdc`: Defines the standards that the pre-commit hook enforces

## Maintenance
Guidelines for maintaining and updating this file:

- When adding new hooks, update this script to copy and make them executable
- Consider adding a check to verify that hooks are installed correctly
- Add backup functionality to preserve any custom hooks

## Additional Notes

### Automatic Installation
Consider adding this script to your project's setup or onboarding process to ensure all developers have the hooks installed.

### CI/CD Integration
For CI/CD pipelines, you may want to create a separate script that performs similar checks without requiring Git hooks.
