# Cleanup Rules

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
- Keep root directory clean
- Organize files by type and purpose
- Use appropriate subdirectories
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

### Designated Directories
- /logs - All log files
- /screenshots - Error and debug screenshots
- /coverage - Test coverage reports
- /artifacts - Build and temporary files
- /docs - Documentation and diagrams

## Artifact Management

### Log Files
- Store in /logs directory
- Use date-based subdirectories
- Implement log rotation
- Clean logs older than 30 days
- Compress historical logs

### Error Screenshots
- Store in /screenshots directory
- Use date-based organization
- Include error context in filename
- Clean screenshots older than 7 days
- Archive if needed for documentation

### Test Artifacts
- Store coverage reports in /coverage
- Clean temporary test files
- Remove empty log files
- Use .gitignore for test artifacts
- Maintain only latest coverage data

### System Files
- Ignore .DS_Store files
- Single virtual environment (prefer venv/)
- Clean pip cache regularly
- Remove duplicate environment files
- Maintain clean git history

## Important Safety Rules

### Never Delete Without Backup
- Always create backups before cleanup
- Verify backup integrity
- Document what was cleaned
- Keep backup for reasonable time
- Have restoration process ready

### Protected Files
- Never auto-delete configuration files
- Preserve important documentation
- Keep security-related files
- Maintain deployment scripts
- Protect database files

### Cleanup Verification
- Verify system still works after cleanup
- Check all tests pass
- Ensure documentation is updated
- Validate backup process
- Test restoration process
