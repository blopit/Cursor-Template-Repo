# Main Entry Point Documentation

## Purpose
This file serves as the entry point for the React application. It renders the root App component into the DOM and sets up the React StrictMode for development.

## Usage
This file is automatically used by Vite when the application starts. It imports and renders the main App component and applies global styles.

```jsx
// The file is imported by the HTML entry point
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
```

## Dependencies
List of dependencies and relationships with other files/components:

- `react` and `react-dom`: Core React libraries
- `App.jsx`: The main application component that gets rendered
- `styles.css`: Global styles for the application

## Maintenance
Guidelines for maintaining and updating this file:

- Update React imports if newer versions or different rendering methods are needed
- Add providers or wrappers around the App component if global state management is required
- Consider adding error boundaries for production applications

## Additional Notes

### React StrictMode
The application is wrapped in `<React.StrictMode>` which helps identify potential problems in the application during development by:
- Identifying components with unsafe lifecycles
- Warning about deprecated API usage
- Detecting unexpected side effects
- Detecting legacy context API

### Future Enhancements
Consider adding:
- Global state management (Redux, Context API)
- Routing configuration
- Theme providers
- Internationalization setup
