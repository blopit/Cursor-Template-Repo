# Test File Documentation

## Purpose
This is a test JavaScript file created to verify the functionality of the pre-commit hook that enforces MDC documentation requirements. It demonstrates how to properly document a JavaScript file according to the project's file creation standards.

## Usage
This file can be imported and used as follows:

```javascript
const testFunction = require('./test_file');

// Call the test function
const result = testFunction();
console.log(result); // true
```

## Dependencies
List of dependencies and relationships with other files/components:

- No external dependencies
- Used by the pre-commit hook testing process

## Maintenance
Guidelines for maintaining and updating this file:

- Update the function implementation if needed for more comprehensive testing
- Keep the documentation in sync with any changes to the file
- Consider adding more test functions to demonstrate different documentation patterns

## Additional Notes

### Testing the Pre-commit Hook
This file is primarily used to test whether the pre-commit hook correctly:
1. Detects files that require MDC documentation
2. Verifies that the referenced MDC file exists
3. Allows or blocks commits based on these checks

### Educational Purpose
This file also serves as an educational example for new developers to understand:
- How to properly document JavaScript files
- How to reference MDC documentation files
- The structure and content required in MDC documentation
